# Profile for GrahamTheDev
Creator of the A11y monsters, hoping to improve accessibility across the web, one line of code at a time!

Currently working on building [tota11y.dev](https://tota11y.dev), an Accessibility as a Service (Aaas) company.

So if you want to help me, tell me which companies would benefit from seeing my AaaS 😱🤣💗
